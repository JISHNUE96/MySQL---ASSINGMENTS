COMMANDS,CONSTRAINS,QUERING DATA,USER DEFINED FUNCTIONS & JOINTS, SUBQUERING..
MySQL Assignments Overview
Commands: This assignment involved using basic and advanced SQL commands to interact with databases. Commands like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE were practiced for data manipulation, while CREATE, ALTER, and DROP were used for database and table management.
Constraints: You explored various constraints to ensure data integrity within the database. This included defining PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, and CHECK constraints to enforce rules on the data being stored.
Querying Data: You worked on retrieving data from tables using different types of queries. This included simple queries, as well as more complex ones using WHERE clauses, GROUP BY, HAVING, and ORDER BY to filter, group, and sort the data.
User-Defined Functions: In this assignment, you created custom functions to perform specific tasks that might not be covered by built-in functions. These functions were designed to take inputs and return a value, allowing for reusable logic within queries.
Joins: You practiced combining data from multiple tables using various types of joins, such as INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN, and FULL OUTER JOIN. This helped in retrieving related data from different tables efficiently.
Subqueries: This task involved writing subqueries, or queries within queries, to solve more complex problems. Subqueries were used in SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE statements, providing a powerful tool for data retrieval and manipulation.
Views: You created views, which are virtual tables representing the result of a stored query. These views simplified complex queries and enhanced data security by limiting access to specific columns or rows.
Stored Procedures: You developed stored procedures to encapsulate repetitive tasks or complex business logic. These procedures, stored in the database, could be executed with a single call, improving efficiency and code reuse.
Triggers: Lastly, you worked on triggers, which are special types of stored procedures that automatically execute in response to certain events on a table, such as INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE. This helped enforce business rules and maintain data integrity automatically.
